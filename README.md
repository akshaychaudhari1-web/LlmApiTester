# Automotive Chat Assistant

A sophisticated web-based AI chat assistant specialized exclusively in automotive topics. Built with Flask, OpenRouter API integration, and featuring secure conversation memory with intelligent content filtering.

## üöó Overview

This application transforms a general-purpose AI chat interface into a focused automotive expert that only discusses cars, engines, maintenance, manufacturers, and related automotive topics. The system includes robust conversation memory, secure API key management, and dual-layer content filtering.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ü§ñ **Automotive-Focused AI**

static/css/custom.css   # Dark theme and chat styling
static/js/editor.js     # Chat functionality and API calls
```

### **Security Architecture**
```
Client Session Cookie ‚Üí Secure Session ID (UUID)
                     ‚Üì
Server-Side Storage ‚Üí {
    api_key: "actual_key",
    model: "selected_model", 
    chat_history: [conversation_array]
}
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenRouter API key

### Environment Variables
```bash
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here  # Optional
```

### Installation
```bash
# Install UV package manager (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies using UV
uv sync

# Or install manually with pip
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy gunicorn psycopg2-binary requests werkzeug email-validator

# Run the application
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --reload main:app
```

### Usage
1. **Configure API Key**: Go to Settings and enter your OpenRouter API key
2. **Start Chatting**: Ask any automotive-related question
3. **Conversation Memory**: Follow up with questions that reference previous discussion
4. **Content Filtering**: Try asking non-automotive questions to see intelligent redirection

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Conversation Memory System
```python
# Session-based conversation storage
conversation_history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What oil should I use for my Honda Civic?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "For Honda Civics, I recommend..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How often should I change it?"},  # Remembers context
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "For the oil we just discussed..."}
]
```

### Content Filtering Pipeline
1. **Frontend Keywords**: 75+ automotive terms including casual conversation words
2. **LLM System Prompt**: Automotive expert persona with topic enforcement
3. **Graceful Redirection**: Polite responses for off-topic queries

### Security Features
- **Server-Side Session Storage**: `secure_sessions[uuid] = {api_key, history}`
- **Masked Client Display**: Never expose actual API keys to frontend
- **Session Isolation**: Each user gets unique conversation context
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Error recovery removes failed messages

## üìä API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/` | GET | Main chat interface |
| `/chat` | POST | Send message and get AI response |
| `/test_openrouter` | POST | Test API connection |
| `/get_session_data` | GET | Get session info (masked) |
| `/clear_session` | POST | Clear all session data |
| `/clear_chat` | POST | Clear conversation history |

## üîç Code Highlights

### Automotive System Prompt
```python
system_prompt = """You are an automotive expert assistant. You ONLY discuss topics related to:
- Cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other vehicles
- Automotive technology, engines, and mechanical systems
- Vehicle maintenance, repair, and troubleshooting
- Car manufacturers, models, and automotive history
- Racing, motorsports, and automotive performance
- Electric vehicles, hybrids, and automotive innovations
- Vehicle safety, regulations, and automotive industry news

If someone asks about anything outside automotive topics, politely redirect them back to car-related discussions."""
```

### Secure Session Management
```python
def get_secure_session_data(session_id):
    if session_id not in secure_sessions:
        secure_sessions[session_id] = {
            'api_key': '',
            'model': 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free',
            'chat_history': []
        }
    return secure_sessions[session_id]
```

### Conversation Memory with Error Recovery
```python
# Add user message
conversation_history.append({'role': 'user', 'content': message})

try:
    response = client.chat_completion(model, conversation_history)
    # Add AI response on success
    conversation_history.append({'role': 'assistant', 'content': response['content']})
except Exception:
    # Remove user message on failure to maintain consistency
    conversation_history.pop()
```

## üéØ Project Evolution

This project evolved from a failing Python IDE for OpenRouter APIs into a specialized automotive chat assistant:

1. **Phase 1**: Fixed deployment issues and API integration
2. **Phase 2**: Removed Python IDE functionality, focused on chat
3. **Phase 3**: Added automotive content filtering and topic enforcement
4. **Phase 4**: Implemented conversation memory and secure session management
5. **Phase 5**: Enhanced security with server-side storage and masked keys

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Current Security Features
- ‚úÖ Server-side API key storage
- ‚úÖ No client-side secret exposure
- ‚úÖ Session-based conversation isolation
- ‚úÖ Input validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ Timeout protection against hanging requests

### Production Recommendations (Not Yet Implemented)
- üîÑ **CSRF Protection**: Currently no CSRF protection on POST endpoints
- üîÑ **Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting implemented - potential for abuse
- üîÑ **Persistent Sessions**: Currently uses in-memory storage (lost on restart)
- üîÑ **Session TTL**: No automatic session cleanup
- üîÑ **Multi-Worker Support**: Sessions won't work with multiple Gunicorn workers

## üìà Performance & Scalability

### Current Capabilities
- **Single Worker**: Optimized for development and testing
- **In-Memory Sessions**: Fast access, but not persistent across restarts
- **20-Message History**: Balanced between context and token efficiency
- **15-Second Timeouts**: Prevents worker blocking

### Scaling Considerations
- Use Redis for shared session storage across workers
- Implement conversation summarization for longer contexts
- Add connection pooling for database operations
- Consider CDN for static assets

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Dark Theme Design
- **Monaco Editor Inspiration**: Clean, professional coding aesthetic
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Responsive design with consistent spacing
- **Feather Icons**: Lightweight, beautiful icon set
- **Chat Bubbles**: Distinct styling for user, assistant, and system messages

### Rich Text Support
- **Markdown-Style Formatting**: Bold, italic, code blocks
- **List Rendering**: Automatic bullet points and numbered lists
- **Paragraph Breaks**: Proper text spacing and readability
- **Loading Indicators**: Real-time feedback during API calls

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Conversation Memory Tests
1. Ask about a specific car model
2. Follow up with "How reliable is it?" (should reference the car)
3. Ask "What about maintenance costs?" (should maintain context)

### Content Filtering Tests
1. Ask about cooking ‚Üí Should redirect to automotive topics
2. Ask about weather ‚Üí Should politely decline and suggest car questions
3. Mix automotive terms with off-topic content ‚Üí Should process automotive parts

### Security Tests
1. Check that API keys are never visible in browser dev tools
2. Verify session isolation between different browser tabs
3. Test error recovery when API calls fail

## üìù Future Enhancement Ideas

### Immediate Improvements
- Add conversation export/import functionality
- Implement conversation search within history
- Add support for uploading car manuals (RAG integration)
- Include automotive image recognition

### Advanced Features
- Multi-language automotive support
- Voice input/output for hands-free interaction
- Integration with automotive databases (VIN lookup, recall info)
- Car recommendation engine based on user preferences
